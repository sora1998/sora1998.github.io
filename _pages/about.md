My name is Enze Ma, and I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)](https://cs.uic.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Philip S. Yu](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/philip-yu/).

My current research interests lie at the intersection of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **AI Agents**, and **Multimodality**. I am passionate about developing intelligent systems that can understand and interact with the world in a more comprehensive and human-like way.

Prior to joining UIC, I spent a year as a research assistant at the [University of California San Diego (UCSD)](https://cse.ucsd.edu/), where I had the valuable opportunity to work with Professor [Zhiting Hu](https://zhiting.ucsd.edu/).

I received both my M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science from [UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/).
